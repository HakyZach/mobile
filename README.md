# Overview

My app is a simple calculator that functions the same way as most others. You use the buttons to enter the operation and the result is displayed at the end.

My goal in making this app was to learn React Native and make something actually useful with it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
